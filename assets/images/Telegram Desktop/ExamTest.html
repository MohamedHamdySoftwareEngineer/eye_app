                The Turing Model is a theoretical model of computation that consists of an infinitely long tape divided into cells, a head that can read and write symbols on the tape, and a set of rules that dictate the head's behavior. The head can read the symbol on the current cell, write a new symbol, and move the tape left or right. The model simulates a computer algorithm by representing the algorithm as a set of rules that the head follows. The limitations of the Turing Model in representing a general-purpose computer are that it is not clear how many types of operations a machine based on this model can perform and it could represent a specific-purpose computer designed to do a single job.

                The Turing Model is a theoretical model of computation, while the Von Neumann Model is a practical architecture for building computers. The key improvement introduced by the Von Neumann architecture is the concept of storing both data and programs in the same memory. This advancement allowed computers to be more flexible and programmable, as programs could be easily loaded and executed without the need for rewiring or switch changes.

                The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a circuit board embedded within a computerâ€™s central processing unit (CPU), which performs mathematical and logical operations using gateways made of electrical transistors that can convey signals in 0s and 1s. It interacts with the Control Unit (CU) by receiving instructions from the CU and performing the corresponding operations on data stored in registers. The CU then uses the results of these operations to control the flow of data and instructions within the computer.

                Before Von Neumann, programming meant changing the wiring system or turning a set of switches on or off. The introduction of stored programs and high-level languages allowed programmers to write more complex and sophisticated software. This led to the development of software engineering as a discipline, with strict rules and principles for the design and writing of structured programs.

                The social and ethical implications of computers include dependency, social justice, privacy, copyright, and computer crime. Dependency refers to the reliance on computers for essential tasks, which can make people's lives more difficult if computers fail. Social justice refers to the unequal access to computers and the Internet, which can create a digital divide. Privacy refers to the collection and use of personal data by computers, which can lead to privacy violations. Copyright refers to the protection of software and other digital content, which can be difficult to enforce. Computer crime refers to the use of computers to commit crimes, such as fraud, theft, and hacking.
